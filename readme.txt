This Python script performs geospatial analysis on traverse data. 

Functionalities:

Data Parsing (dataParsing function):

Reads traverse data from a traverse_data.csv file.

Validates the data format (likely expects specific data structures for points and attributes).

Traverse Analysis.py :

- Contains functions for calculating distance and bearing between consecutive points in the traverse data.

Plotting.py:
- Contains functions for visualizing traverse data using Matplotlib.
-Generates a plot representing the traverse points and connecting lines (legs) between them.

Graphical User Interface (GUI) (main.py):
Implements a simple GUI using the Tkinter library to interact with users, allowing them to select the traverse data file and initiate analysis and visualization.

Creates a user-friendly interface for interacting with the script. This likely includes functionalities for selecting the data file and visualizing the results.

To use the tool:
- Run main.py and follow the instructions on the GUI.
- Ensure that Python and the required libraries (Tkinter, Matplotlib) are installed on your system.
